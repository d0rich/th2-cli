## Install th2

If you already have configurations in [`th2-cli-install-config.yaml` or `secrets.yaml`](/config-templates), it will be convenient to run process from the directory with these files.
In other case CLI will create these config files during installation.

```shell
th2 install
```

## Delete th2

```shell
th2 delete
```

## Update th2

```shell
th2 delete
```

Wait until all required namespaces are terminated.

```shell
th2 install
```

## Get th2 status

Display information about all th2-related namespaces in Kubernetes.

```shell
th2 status
```

## infra-mgr

Display status of infra-mgr pod:

```shell
th2 mgr status
```

Display last logs of infra-mgr pod:

```shell
th2 mgr logs
```
