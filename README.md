Works with th2 1.7.3

## Using

Install:

```commandline
pip install th2-cli
```

### Install th2

If you already have configurations in `th2-cli-install-config.yaml` or `secrets.yaml`, it will be convenient to run process from the directory with these files.
In other case CLI will create these config files during installation.

```commandline
th2 install
```

### Delete th2

```commandline
th2 delete
```

### Update th2

```commandline
th2 delete
```

Wait until all required namespaces are terminated.

```commandline
th2 install
```

### Get th2 status

Display information about all th2-related namespaces in Kubernetes.

```commandline
th2 status
```

### infra-mgr

Display status of infra-mgr pod:

```commandline
th2 mgr status
```

Display last logs of infra-mgr pod:

```commandline
th2 mgr logs
```
